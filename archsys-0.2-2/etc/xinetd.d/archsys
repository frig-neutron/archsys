# 
# xinetd service configuration for backup script.
#
# For those just tuning in, archsys works by taking an LVM snapshot of 
# the volumes you want to backup (one at a time), then either mounts the
# snapshot or reads it from the device file depending on options.
#
# To configure:
#   service: name xinetd will call this service
#   server_args: 
#      --volumes=/vol1:/vol2:/vol3/sub
#      --howToRead= on of ...
#           dd
#           rsync:/mount/snapshot/at
#           tar:/mount/snapshot/at
#      --debug=y (optional)
# 
# multiple archsys-* blocks are allowed if different volumes require
# different handling.
#
